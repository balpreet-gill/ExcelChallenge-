## Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter dataset, campaign outcomes were visualized to provide accurate information to Louise about how differect campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenge

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges encountered were formating the pivot charts especially assigning colors to data points. It was very helpful to have an idea of what the final deliverable should look like, but it was more challenging than expected to come up with the similar structure and formatting. The challenge with formatting the pivot tables was overcome by trying different options under formatting and experiemnting with those options. 

## Results
- Two conclusions drawn from the Outcomes based on Launch Date were that:
1. May and June turned out to be the best months for launching theater productions. 
2. Most canceled theater campaigns fell in January comapred to all other months, 

- Outcomes based on Goals have shown that Goals less than $5000 had more success and goals between $25,000 to $34,999 had more failed percentage overall. 

- The limitation of this dataset is that it is only based on goals and launch date, which excludes other important measures to accurately describe the difference between successful and failed theater outcomes. 

- Other graphs that could potentially be extracted out of this data set are box and whisker plots,
